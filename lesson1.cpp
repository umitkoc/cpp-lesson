//pointer with referance semantics is the difference between?

pointer
pointer to pointer :true

referance semantics
referance to referance: false

//why R value category is important?
/*
Because move semantics and perfect forwarding to use for important.

what is struct with class different between?

+ Classes are of reference types.	
- Structs are of value types.
+ All the reference types are allocated on heap memory.	
- All the value types are allocated on stack memory.
+ Allocation of large reference type is cheaper than allocation of large value type.
- Allocation and de-allocation is cheaper in value type as compare to reference type.
+ Class has limitless features.	Struct has limited features.
- Class is generally used in large programs.
+ Struct are used in small programs.
- Classes can contain constructor or destructor.
+ Structure does not contain parameter less constructor or destructor, but can contain Parameterized constructor or static constructor.
- Classes used new keyword for creating instances.
+ Struct can create an instance, with or without new keyword.
- A Class can inherit from another class.
+ A Struct is not allowed to inherit from another struct or class.
- The data member of a class can be protected.
+ The data member of struct canâ€™t be protected.
- Function member of the class can be virtual or abstract.
+ Function member of the struct cannot be virtual or abstract.
- Two variable of class can contain the reference of the same object and any operation on one variable can affect another variable.	
+ Each variable in struct contains its own copy of data(except in ref and out parameter variable) and any operation on one variable can not effect another variable.

/*
 What is refererance type and value type?

 Value type is real value type.

 Referance type is another data type referance value.
